# Neovim-Setup for Windows 10



Disclaimer: I know nothing about vim (for real no joke)

In this repository, I will provide a step-by-step process to set up Neovim for Windows 10. It took me a while to get it to work with intense help from the internet. When I first came across vim editor, I was really fascinated and enchanted by the whole idea of using a keyboard with so many shortcuts that will make coding a lot quicker and most importantly enjoyable.
